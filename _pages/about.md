## Hello!
### Welcome to my Website! 

I am a Doctoral Candidate in [Planning, Public Policy and Management](https://mnm.uoregon.edu/) at the [University of Oregon](https://www.uoregon.edu/), specializing in urban governance and sustainability, as well as environmental governance in crises. I aim to make an impact in research and policy regarding governance to promote equitable access to sustainable urban mobility, especially for vulnerable groups such as women and informal transport workers. I hold a Master of Public Policy from Oregon State University and a Master's and Bachelorâ€™s degree in Development Studies from the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh.

I have authored and co-authored publications on the environmental impacts of refugee camps, the effects of climate change on transit ridership, and urban governance.

I actively present my work at major conferences such as APPAM and the APRU Sustainable Cities & Landscapes Conference. I am also engaged in academic leadership and service, including serving as a journal peer reviewer and mentoring in equity and inclusion programs.

Languages spoken include Bengali, English, Urdu, Hindi, and intermediate Arabic.
